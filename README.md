# Daily_Planner_App_EDementieva

## Description

The task in this Challenge is to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code.

In this Challenge I applied the core skills we've recently learned, such as DOM manipulation, JavaScript and jQuery. I also used the Moment.js library to work with date and time.

The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS, all powered by jQuery. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage of the application:

The app displays the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner.

It presents timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.

Timeblocks are color-coded based on the past, present, and future hour.

A user can enter an event when they click a timeblock.

A user can save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

Events persist between refreshes of a page.
